- should add clock half edge: first half for register writing and last half for register reading.
- implemment without hazard handleing --> add hazard detecting --> add hazard handling
- The decode (decomposition) should already be done before proceeding to ID stage, i.e. the Rs, Rt .. parts should be there. It is for Load-use Hazard Detection Unit // maybe, just 32bit instruction may be okay
- Let's implement R-type first, then I and J type.

- Hazard handling memo
 - "Computing branch target address can be done in parallel with RegFile read (done for all instructions â€“ only used when needed)"
