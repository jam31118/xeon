- should add clock half edge: first half for register writing and last half for register reading.
- implemment without hazard handleing --> add hazard detecting --> add hazard handling
- The decode (decomposition) should already be done before proceeding to ID stage, i.e. the Rs, Rt .. parts should be there. It is for Load-use Hazard Detection Unit // maybe, just 32bit instruction may be okay
- Let's implement R-type first, then I and J type.

- Hazard handling memo
 - "Computing branch target address can be done in parallel with RegFile read (done for all instructions â€“ only used when needed)"

- should implement initializeXeon()
- fix gitstuff

- Which is faster? Probabily, and necessarily, mem_write signal should be arrived to mem first. .. exactly which stages when signal arrives
- add ssh autologin
- if something goes wrong, functions returns 1. We should check this results and if one of them returns 1 then we should stop program and should cerr << (error messeage).

- to do before 22:00
 - implement ID stage completely, including Control and ID stage _head() and _tail() etc.
 - so that direct pasting to main function would work
